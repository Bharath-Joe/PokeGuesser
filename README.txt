App Name: PokéGuesser

Description: The premise of this project is to provide users with an interactive way of guessing
Pokemon, utilizing the sound a Pokemon makes and certain characteristics of the Pokemon.

Changes Since Midterm Report: There have been no significant goal changes since the midterm report.
I was able to accomplish everything I wanted to given the time we were allocated. I was able to add
a few new features, which include the ability to share your profile, adjusting the difficulty of
your guessing, and the ability utilize the app as a 'Guest' without having to login to your gmail.

Deliverables Met:
1. Utilize the Pokémon API to provide users with hints, enabling them to make educated guesses.
2. Assign points to users based on their performance, taking into account the number of hints used
and the time taken.
3. Inform users whether their guess was correct or incorrect and provide the correct answer if it
was wrong.
4. Display users' highest scores, the corresponding Pokémon that achieved those scores, by retrieving
them from the Cloud Firestore Database.
5. Implement a visually pleasing color theme to enhance the application's appeal.
6. Implement Google Authentication for user authentication and account management using Firebase Auth.
7. Utilize a database or API to access Pokémon sounds, assisting users in their guesses.
8. Ability to share your profile via messages/Facebook/WhatsApp etc.
9. Implement a difficulty option for users based on the generation of Pokemon.
10. Storing all users playing the game as well as their highest score and Pokémon using Cloud Firestore.

Deliverables NOT Met: NONE
