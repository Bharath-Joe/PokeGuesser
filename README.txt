Description: The premise of this project is to provide users with an interactive way of guessing
Pokemon, utilizing the sound a Pokemon makes and certain characteristics of the Pokemon.

Changes Since Midterm Report: There have been no significant goal changes since the midterm report.
I was able to accomplish everything I wanted to given the time we were allocated.

Deliverables Met:
1. Utilize the Pokémon API to provide users with hints, enabling them to make educated guesses.
2. Assign points to users based on their performance, taking into account the number of hints used
and the time taken.
3. Inform users whether their guess was correct or incorrect and provide the correct answer if it
was wrong.
4. Display users' highest scores, the corresponding Pokémon that achieved those scores,
and the time it took for each guess.
5. Implement a visually pleasing color theme to enhance the application's appeal.
6. Implement Google Authentication for user authentication and account management.
7. Utilize a database or API to access Pokémon sounds, assisting users in their guesses.
8. Ability to share your profile via messages/Facebook/WhatsApp etc.
9. Implement a difficulty option for users based on the generation of Pokemon.

Deliverables NOT Met:
1. Storing all users playing the game as well as their highest score and Pokémon, in the Firebase
App.
